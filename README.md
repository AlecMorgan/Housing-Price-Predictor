# Housing Price Predictor

## Project Description

In this project we look to predict the prices of houses in King County using multivariate linear regression. We aim to be able to give this model to a company that is looking to price houses in the area. To build a model we used number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, if it was a waterfront property, the number of sides with a view, house condition, number of floors, latitude, longitude, and distance from downtown Seattle. This predicts with an average MAE value around 75,00 dollars. In the future, we would like to improve on this model by normalizing some of the factors as well as possibly engineer new features that could more accurately predict the price.
